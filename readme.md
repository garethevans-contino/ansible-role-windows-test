## Purpose

To have a template repository with the minimum required pre-commit hooks ready to ensure developers are able to work without obsticles from security and linting checks but also a customisable platform for them to build on to help improve code quality.

### Technology
We're using Pre-Commit Hooks and configuration from [https://pre-commit.com/](https://pre-commit.com/)

## Setup

### Developer(s) Machines Setup

#### Pre-Commit
Run```pip install pre-commit``` or ```brew install pre-commit``` on the developer machine to install pre-commit.
https://pre-commit.com/#install

#### Detect Secrets
Run ```pip install detect-secrets``` to install detect-secrets.
https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets
https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets-server

##### Using Detect-Secrets
To create a new baseline remove the .secrets.baseline file and run ```detect-secrets audit .secrets.baseline```
To audit a baseline run ```detect-secrets audit .secrets.baseline```
To scan/update a baseline run ```detect-secrets scan --update .secrets.baseline```

A baseline is an "white list" of secrets so the allowed secrets aren't caught in the scans.

### Repository Setup
Create a new repository, remember *DO NOT* include any README otherwise it creates a master branch!

Run:
```
git remote add base <urlToThisRepo>
git fetch base
git merge base/master
git push origin master
```

This pulls the content of the base repo into the new repository - similar to copying files from one directory into another but this has the added bonus that if a change is made to the base repository, we can pull those changes in and have the full commit history to go with it.

## How to use

### Setup
To setup the repositroy for running pre-commit run ```pre-commit install```.

### Run automatically.
Make a change and commit your changes, this will run the pre-commit hooks.

### Run manually
To run pre-commit manually, run ```pre-commit run -a```.

### How to bypass
This is only to be used in an emergency as it will bypass the pre-commit hook checks.
```git commit -m "<message>" --no-verify```
